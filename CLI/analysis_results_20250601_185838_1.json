Overview of the Algorithm\n\nThe provided code uses a binary search approach to find the minimum eating speed `K` that allows Koko to finish eating the bananas within `h` hours.\n\n### 2. Time Complexity Analysis\n\n#### `canFinish` Function\n\n* The `canFinish` function calculates the total hours needed to finish eating the bananas at a given eating speed `k`.\n* It uses a generator expression to sum up the hours needed for each pile of bananas: `sum((p + k - 1) // k for p in piles)`.\n* The time complexity of this function is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of piles of bananas.\n\n#### `minEatingSpeed` Function\n\n* The `minEatingSpeed` function uses a binary search approach to find the minimum eating speed `K`.\n* The binary search loop runs until `lo` and `hi` converge.\n* In each iteration, the `canFinish` function is called, which has a time complexity of **O(n)**.\n* The number of iterations in the binary search loop is **O(log m)**, where `m` is the maximum number of bananas in a pile (i.e., `max(piles)`).\n* Therefore, the overall time complexity of the `minEatingSpeed` function is **O(n log m)**.\n\n### 3. Space Complexity Analysis\n\n* The `minEatingSpeed` function uses a constant amount of space to store the `lo`, `hi`, and `mid` variables.\n* The `canFinish` function uses a generator expression, which does not allocate any additional memory that scales with the input size.\n* Therefore, the space complexity of the `minEatingSpeed` function is **O(1)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n* Time Complexity: **O(n log m)**, where `n` is the number of piles of bananas and `m` is the maximum number of bananas in a pile.\n* Space Complexity: **O(1)**, which means the space usage does not grow with the input size.\n\nThe provided code has an efficient time complexity, making it suitable for large inputs. The space complexity is constant, which is ideal for memory-constrained environments.",
